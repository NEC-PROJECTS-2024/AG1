INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, digital images are a main source of shared information in social media. Meanwhile, malicious software can forge such images for fake information. Such images are the primary sources of spreading fake news and misleading information in the context of society with the aid of diverse social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. In order to detect these type of forgeries, we propose a model that employs Error Level Analysis (ELA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). ELA is used as a preprocessing step to highlight regions of an image that may have been tampered with. CNN is then trained on this enhanced data to classify images based on their authenticity and detect digital modifications. This initiative's main goals include image classification, attribute extraction, image authenticity verification, and digital image modification detection. Our suggested solution makes use of CNNs' deep learning capabilities and the refinement found by ELA.
