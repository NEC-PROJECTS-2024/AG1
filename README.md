INTRODUCTION

Loans are a crucial part of the modern world, and banks receive a significant portion of their profits from them. However, deciding whether to grant a loan to an applicant is a complex process that requires banks to consider many factors. In this project, we propose a machine learning-based approach to ease the process of loan approval prediction. We use efficient machine learning algorithms to predict whether an applicantâ€™s profile is relevant for loan approval or not. We use key features to make our predictions. We also provide a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms to highlight the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in improving the loan approval process. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can significantly reduce the risk of loan defaults and improve the loan approval process.
